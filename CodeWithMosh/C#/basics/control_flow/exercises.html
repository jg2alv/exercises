<p style=""><strong style="">Note: </strong>for all these exercises, ignore input validation unless otherwise directed. Assume the user enters a value in the format that the program expects. For example, if the program expects the user to enter a number, don&#039;t worry about validating if the input is a number or not. When testing your program, simply enter a number.<br style=""></p><p style=""><br style=""></p><p style="">1- Write a program to count how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 3 with no remainder. Display the count on the console.<br style=""></p><p style=""><br style=""></p><p style="">2- Write a program and continuously ask the user to enter a number or &quot;ok&quot; to exit. Calculate the sum of all the previously entered numbers and display it on the console.<br style=""></p><p style=""><br style=""></p><p style="">3- Write a program and ask the user to enter a number. Compute the factorial of the number and print it on the console. For example, if the user enters 5, the program should calculate 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 and display it as 5! = 120.<br style=""></p><p style=""><br style=""></p><p style="">4- Write a program that picks a random number between 1 and 10. Give the user 4 chances to guess the number. If the user guesses the number, display “You won&quot;; otherwise, display “You lost&quot;. (To make sure the program is behaving correctly, you can display the secret number on the console first.)</p><p style=""><br style=""></p><p style="">5- Write a program and ask the user to enter a series of numbers separated by comma. Find the maximum of the numbers and display it on the console. For example, if the user enters “5, 3, 8, 1, 4&quot;, the program should display 8.</p><p style=""><br style=""></p><p style=""><br style=""></p><p style=""><br style=""></p>
